  ## Description  ‚úèÔ∏è
  
  A place to track and watch upcoming and favorite movie & tv shows.

  This appication is in-progress. This is the client side. 

  ### Interesting Problems Solved During Building

  **Problem:** On page load, for the main page slide show, it is necessary to make 21 api calls due to the information required and the way the TMDB api is set up. This brings me to my first interesting problem with this application. I don't want any performance issues due to this amount of calls.  

  **Solution:** After weighing pros & cons of various approaches, and keeping React Query's power at the forefront of my thinking, I am making only 3 api calls on page load - the 20 movies, and the title logos for only two movies (the title logos require a separate hit by movie id to an images endpoint, this is where 20 extra fetches come into play). Then, as the slideshow goes on, or as the user hits the next button, I am prefetching the next logo that will be needed while filling up the React Query cache and then relying on the cache from that point forward. 
  Initial load  850-1000ms  
  New load time = 400-560ms  Roughly 50% improvement. 

  **Problem:** The addition of three sliding movie components below the slide increased loading time for three additional api calls. 

  **Solution:** Created a fetch on demand only when the user scrolls down, as caught by the react intersection observer. This prevents any fetching if the user never scrolls down, and fetches when the slider component is at a threshold of 0.1.
