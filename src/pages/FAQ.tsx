            answer: "Your ISP will only know that you are watching videos, not what the videos are or whether you paid for them or not. Your ISP will see it as similar to YouTube. BingeBox uses servers with DMCA protected links and we do not engage in any copyright infrigement. We recommend that you use a VPN if you are concerned about your privacy."

            question: "Sometimes I can't find what I am looking for, what do I do?",
            answer: "BingeBox is not responsible for the content of the servers we link to, therefore we can't help you if you don't find something you are looking for. However, this is often a temporary problem and we encourage you to check back later. We provide multiple servers including multi-server embeds, so please make sure you are checking all possible resources. Look for a cloud icon, a gearbox icon, or a dropdown menu to see additional servers not listed in the main list."
