        'BingeBox is 100% free. We may start accepting donations in the future, strictly for your appreciation of the site, not the content.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What about all these popups & redirects?',
      answer:
        "We aren't putting those on you, they come from the servers we link to that allow you to stream content. To some extent it is understandable that content providers need money coming in, but we can't always be sure that the popups are safe or appropriate. If you want to block the popups, the recommendations are as follows: 1) If you are on Safari IOS mobile, you can go into settings for Safari, and under advanced options, then feature flags, you can find a toggle to verify the window.open function. This will stop almost everything (100% all redirects/popups on SOME servers) and some of your taps will appear to do nothing. This is the absolute most comprehensive approach. 2) On Chrome or Firefox desktop, you can add Poper Blocker. 3) For Android, we think Firefox + uBlock is a good option. 4) Brave browser is another option in \"Shields Up\" mode but on iOS it can't stop all the pop-ups & redirects and isn't nearly as good as #1. 4) We are working on ad blocking options you will be able to opt into later.",
    },
    {
      question:
        'Is this site illegal for me to use? Will my ISP know I am using it?',
      answer:
        'Your ISP will only know that you are watching videos, not what the videos are or whether you paid for them or not. Your ISP will see it as similar to YouTube. BingeBox uses servers with DMCA protected links and we do not engage in any copyright infrigement. We recommend that you use a VPN if you are concerned about your privacy. ',
    },
    {
      question: "Sometimes I can't find what I am looking for, what do I do?",
      answer:
        "BingeBox is not responsible for the content of the servers we link to, therefore we can't help you if you don't find something you are looking for. However, this is often a temporary problem and we encourage you to check back later. We provide multiple servers including multi-server embeds, so please make sure you are checking all possible resources. Look for a cloud icon, a gearbox icon, or a dropdown menu to see additional servers not listed in the main list.",
